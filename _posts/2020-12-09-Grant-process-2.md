# Grant Process 2 Blog


  My grant “A Lying White Christmas'' is a mapping project. I will use Omeka to create an interactive map. That shows people where Christmas movies take place and the weather patterns in that region. I will expand on my topic more and then expand on how the grant process went. Throughout the grant process, I have come to understand three things. First, grants change multiple times throughout the process. Second, grant proposals take a lot of hard work and effort. Last, Digital Humanities projects are never truly finished.



  The reason why I chose this project was that I wanted to combine media and digital humanities. I also wanted to add a scholarship aspect, which is why I added the part about climate change. I’m positive that creating a project that is fun but also informative project will give people a better understanding of our world. The start of my proposal was something small and then became bigger as I did more research. My project (if actually produced) would be a good project for future generations.

  Grants change multiple times throughout the process. At first, I just wanted to do something with Christmas movies. It then developed to Christmas movies and something about the snow in them. Lastly, my final project was Christmas movies and climate change. The point of projects changing over time is so they grow into some with great potential. Although, one thing that was hard was having to change things such as; my environmental scan and grant narrative. But, I think my final project will be a success.



   Grant proposals take a lot of work. I spent long nights trying to figure out how this project was going to come together because I’ve never done anything like it before. I had to rewrite my environmental scan multiple times until it really captured what I wanted. Then I had done more research on the platform I would be using (Omeka), in order to write my grant narrative. My CV took a long time to configure because I’ve never written one.  I couldn’t imagine writing a full grant proposal and how long it would take someone to write.



  Lastly, digital humanities projects are never fully finished. I will not be making my grant exactly but, every DH project has some sort of time period, but times change. And the DH projects that go with that should also change with time. DH is an ever-evolving field with projects constantly creating. If my project were to be created I would have to keep up with the times of the project, constantly updating and changing to fit the needs of that time.



  In conclusion, My project “A (Lying) White Christmas” would be a great asset to the digital humanities field. However, DH’s work is hard and requires time and dedication. Writing this grant proposal created some stress for me but in the end, I learned a small but rewarding amount of what goes into the process of creating a digital humanities project.
