# TEI Review
The “Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkin Stenson is a story about a woman who feels trapped in a relationship with her controlling, condescending husband, to the point she starts hallucinating about being trapped in the yellow wallpaper in their home. The TEI coding of the “Yellow Wallpaper” was a project to understand how coding works and to get a deeper understanding of the paper. We used Oxygen Lite to perform the TEI and I had page 652, column 2.  The purpose was to code our portion of the paper into TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) a standard of XML (extensible Markup language). This project was very overwhelming at first for a couple of reasons. Yet, by the end I felt comfortable coding and even with some mistakes I finished it correctly. I will reflect on this project by talking about my TEI on paper (a Google Doc and actually coding the project in oxygen. 
I had page 652, column 2. In this part of the story, the narrator is talking to her husband at night about what she sees in the yellow wallpaper. John is convinced there is nothing wrong with her and the narrator is convinced that there is someone, a woman, stuck in the wallpaper trying to get out. In this part of the story there is a lot of dialogue going on, so my code included a lot of quotes, also, multiple paragraphs in this section. There were not too many em dashes, there were only 1 of them and there were no misspelled words and only one italicized word. Being able to go through the google doc and highlight every paragraph, em dash, and quote. Putting the TEI on paper really helps with organizing how the coding is going to flow and how to do the coding correctly.

I didn't have a lot of trouble using oxygen, it was very overwhelming at first because I have never used it before. One of my biggest problems was staring and ending paragraphs and quotes, the code to do this is <p> and </p> and for quotes is <q> and </q>. Sometimes the program would automatically put the end symbol for you but sometimes it would not, so making sure that the paragraph and quote started and ended correctly was important. The em dash code was very confusing, this is the code for the em dash (&#8212). Making sure the spacing was correct because if it wasn't then then em dash would appear. The hardest part about coding was my one italicized word, <emph rend=“italic”>Text here</emph>, It was difficult to understand how the code works, I struggle with it multiple times but after  walking through it and saying it out loud, I finally was able to italicize words. All in all, this part of the project was tedious but wasn't very difficult.

In conclusion, using TEi and oxygen to create this version of the yellow wallpaper was very simple and straightforward. Getting all of my TEi coding on paper and then being able to do it in the computer was very helpful and it gave me a better understanding of “The Yellow Wallpaper”.
