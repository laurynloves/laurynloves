# TEI Review
The “Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkin Stenson is a story about a woman who feels trapped in a relationship with her controlling, condescending husband, to the point she starts hallucinating about being trapped in the yellow wallpaper in their home. The TEI coding of the “Yellow Wallpaper” was a project to understand how coding works and to get a deeper understanding of the paper. We used Oxygen Lite to perform the TEI and I had page 652, column 2.  The purpose was to code our portion of the paper into TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) a standard of XML (extensible Markup language). This project was very overwhelming at first for a couple of reasons. Yet, by the end I felt comfortable coding and even with some mistakes I finished it correctly. I will reflect on this project by talking about my TEI on paper (a Google Doc and actually coding the project in oxygen.
