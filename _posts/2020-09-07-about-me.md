# Lauryn with a y
Hello everyone I’m Lauryn. I’m a senior at Christopher Newport University, majoring in Communication and minoring in Digital Humanities.
 My preferred pronouns are She/Her.
 My interest in taking Digital Humanities is because I love media! [My insta follow me ;)](https://www.instagram.com/lauryn.lovess/?hl=en)
  I have mostly taken COMM media related courses, so being a part of the DH minor and understanding how the digital world works.
## Career 
My dream broadway goal is to be a screenplay writer/ director.
 My biggest goal is to be the first female director of a **Star Wars** film, maybe i'll get there maybe not.
 I’m hoping to go to grad school next fall for my masters in [Film and Media Production at American University.](https://www.american.edu/soc/film/ma/ma-flma-new.cfm)
 After my Master's I'm hoping to move to Burbank, California to work for [Disney Animation Studios](https://www.disneyanimation.com/)
 I have always loved movies every since I was a little girl, and I have always wanted to know how, why, when they were made. Media (escially movies) bring me a lot of joy. 


 Every year I am a Spark Intern for Newport News public school, except this year, **Thanks COVID.**
 My sophomore year of college I was accepted into the Disney College Program, I worked in the Magic Kingdom at Pirates of the Carribean for 6 months ![Alt Text](https://laurynloves.github.io/laurynloves/images/A0050E6D-E04B-4485-9B79-706D655899CF.jpeg)
I’m a member of Gamma Phi Beta, I never thought I would join greek life in college, it was not a part of my plan but I did and I really enjoy it ![My favorite Memory](https://laurynloves.github.io/laurynloves/images/3E182BE6-EE9E-4F0E-A0FD-2E1B5D557880.jpeg)
Having some of the best friends I could ask for really has made college easier.
