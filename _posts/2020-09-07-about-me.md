# ABOUT ME! (Lauryn with a y)
Hello everyone I’m Lauryn. I’m a senior at Christopher Newport University, majoring in Communication and minoring in Digital Humanities.
 My preferred pronouns are She/Her.
 My interest in taking Digital Humanities is because I love media! [My insta follow me ;)](https://www.instagram.com/lauryn.lovess/?hl=en)
  I have mostly taken COMM media related courses, so being a part of the DH minor is really important to me.
## Career 
I want to be a screenplay writer/ director.
 My biggest goal is to be the first female director of a **Star Wars** film, maybe i'll get there maybe not.
 I’m hoping to go to grad school next fall for my masters in [Film and Media Production at American University.](https://www.american.edu/soc/film/ma/ma-flma-new.cfm)
 ## Acheviments 
 Every year I am a Spark Intern for Newport News public school, except this year, **Thanks COVID.**
 My sophomore year of college I was accepted into the Disney College Program, I worked in the Magic Kingdom at Pirates of the Carribean for 6 months ![Alt Text](link)
