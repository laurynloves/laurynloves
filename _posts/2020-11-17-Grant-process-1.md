# A (Lying) White Christmas 
My project is called “ A (lying) White Christmas” . This is a mapping project using Omeka, it will show a flat map of the world and it will be decorated like christmas. There will be red pinpoints on the map that indicate where top grossing movies from 1999-2019 took place, for example (Home Alone- (Illinois and Pairs)). Then, when you scroll over the pinpoint there will be information such as, where the movie takes place, how much the movie made ( as in how many people saw it in theaters), how much it snowed in the movie and how much it actually snows in that region. I got the idea to do this because everyone watches christmas movies especially around this time of year and I think I can kill two birds with one stone with this project, make a cool project that also informs people about the world around us.

My research has shown not many people have thought about making DH projects that are fun and information giving, it’s either one or the other, for example my previous review of the Digital WItch Project is a fun project about witch movies and the “Anthroposcene” is all pure scholarly information about climate change, however I never found any about something that was important like climate change and something fun like movies. Doing research on the topic of climate change is really disheartening because of how long it was just ignored, back in the 60’s 70’s when winter got a little bit warm it was just seen as “weird” and a “strange day” when in reality it was how earth was crying out for help. My research did change a little bit when i was looking at certain movies that take place in the north pole and antarctica, I had to find out more about the ice caps melting, and how it is affecting wildlife. 
My project started has just a christmas movie project, I wasn't initially going to have climate change be another topic in it, and i was scrolling on twitter one day and i saw a tweet about climate change and that's when it dawned on me that I can have a project that fun but also informative. I didn't know much about what technology to use but after searching Omeka seems the easiest to use. Writing environmental scan was different for me because I usually write papers about the things I research and build off of, but for this I had to say how my project was essentially better than the research that I did. 
I haven't found many projects like mine, I have found projects that are about climate change and I found some that are about movies, tv shows, but not both, I think my ideal is really original and if I could actually make it. If we added more scholarships thay had a fun component, people would enjoy digital humanities projects more and would appreciate them. I’m excited for my project and where it goes.
