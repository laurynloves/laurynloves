  The purpose of the **“The Digital Witch Project ”** is to understand the dialogue and images of the witch genre. The authors do this by creating a methodology using digital tools that analyze different stills from witch films and the similarity between films from the 1970’s up until 2015. While done well, there are some points in the project that are unclear. The project is set up in order by Abstract, this explains what the purpose of the project is and how the project is set up. Next is Witches Genres and Cycles, this part of the project gives more of an in depth version of what witch films are and how witches are portrayed in society. Then there is, Digital Humanities projects on film, where they state what they used to make the graphs and charts that helped them and then goes into the analysis of the project.
  The project is set up very well, the way the site flows from topic to topic is seamless and the perfect way to look at one topic without being distracted by another. The visualization of the project is very minimal, which is nice because it is not very distracting and it keeps the reader focused on the subject at hand. This project starts off with the sub heading Witches, Genres and Cycles. It's a very informative section of the project and it helps with understanding of witch films and why they are made. It brings in a scholarly work that has been published about the culture of witches, “Andrew Tudor centered on sociological and psychological context in his definition of genre, arguing that genre is “what we collectively believe it to be” (139).” This quote proves that this is a humanities project that has been brought into the digital world. 
  The visual analysis of the project was unclear in certain spots, there are times where you need to go back to understand what they are analyzing and how. The wording of the explanation of the analysis needs more clarity. However, the analysis itself is done very well. In the analysis they compared the movie poster of witch films and how they relate to one another, in the sense of polar visualization of brightness and hue. 
The other analysis is a textual analysis of the script of the movies based off of 6 different witch movies that came out in different decades, from _“Snow White and the Seven Dwafs_ to _“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.”_ The analysis is about looking at  the dialogue of witch movies and seeing their similarity. The graphs that are shown are easy to read and incisive of their discovery.

  All in all, the project is done very well, the site is easy to navigate, images and graphs are easy to read and understand. The only thing that could be critiqued is the unclarity in some spot of the visualization analysis. The project gives people more information about a niche genre of films and a visualization of how they relate to one another.
