  The purpose of the “The Digital Witch Project ” is to understand the dialogue and images of the witch genre. The authors do this by creating a method using digital tools that analyze different film stills from witch films and the similarity of the script from the 1970’s up until 2015. While done well, there are some points in the project that are unclear. The project is set up in order by Abstract, this explains what the purpose of the project is and how the project is set up. Witches Genres and Cycles, this part of the project gives more of an in depth version of what witch films are and how witches are portrayed  in society. The Corpus Development and Collection, part of the project explains what  a "witch" film is and the highest grossing witch films of all time. Then there is, Digital Humanities projects on film, where the authors talk about what tools they used to create the graphs and charts. The project is making observations from scholarly work and putting them into graphs and charts to bring it into the digital world.
 
The project is set up very well, the way the site flows from topic to topic is consistent and the perfect way to look at one topic without being distracted by another.
 
The look of the project is very minimal, which is nice because it is not very distracting and it keeps the reader focused on the subject at hand. This project starts off with the sub heading Witches, Genres and Cycles. It is a very helpful section of the project and it goes into the understanding of witch films and why they are being produced. It brings in work that is being published about the culture of witches, “When witchcraft became aligned with the women’s liberation movement in the 1970s, interest in and media representations of witches boomed (Foltz) (2018)” This quote is from the project, and exemplifies the fact that witches have always been a member of our culture. The way the project
 
The visual analysis of the project was unclear in certain spots, there are times where you need to go back to understand what they are analyzing and how. The wording of the explanation of the analysis needs more clarity. Yet, the analysis is successful in helping the reader understand what is happening . In the visual analysis they compared witch movie posters. They did this but compared the polar visualization of brightness and hue. In the textual analysis, they analyze six different witch movies that came out in different decades. From “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", they analyze how the script  of the movies relate to one another.  The graphs that authors created are easy to read and incisive of their discovery.

All in all, the project is very well, the site is easy to navigate, images and graphs are easy to read and understand. The only thing that could be critique is the unclarity in some spot of the visualization analysis. The project gives people more information about a niche genre of films and a visualization of how they relate to one another.
